It tastes frozen. I thought this place was a chain restaurant like Chili's. I asked the waiter and he said this is the one and only.\n\nI can't remember exactly what drink we got, but it was very watered down. There was basically no alcohol in it. The barbecue shrimp was pretty good. It reminded me of an Asian dish my mom makes all the time. The shrimp was huge too. I had a Cajun Jambalaya pasta. It was very good, but I feel like there was a lot of dairy product mixed in. The alligator sausage was my favorite part. :)  My brother-in-law had the redfish. It was tasty, but rubbery. I assume it is because it might have been frozen. \n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was very funny and helpful. The outdoor seating was beautiful. I wish we were sat out there. Overall, if you are up for a late night dinner and every where else is closed or has no more room.",

Normally wonder about places when the Hop on/off trolleys forced discount coupons on us, but Oceana was definitely a surprise, nice atmospheric brick walls and pillars, friendly staff and great food.\nCarol ordered the Alligator bites appetizer...which had a great breading and spicy dipping sauce, but it was still alligator. \nI ordered a Tidal Wave \"Juggles Favorite. \"  Which is 1800 Silver, Midori and Tropical juices.  Excellent!\nCarol ordered Jambalaya on pasta which was very good.  I had Crab cakes with a crawdads gravy and mashed potatoes and collard green, which I enjoyed.\nDian, however had the Oceania Red Fish with fried crawdads.  The fish was over cooked and had a part so dry she couldn't even eat it.  She said it was bland and under seasoned.  \nThey offered her another puece, but by then she was done with it.  They didn't offer any price reduction or dessert.\nSo three out five...just ovoid the red fish.",

We were a little nervous considering this restaurant was featured on Kitchen Nightmares, but decided enough time had passed and improvements were probably made. Was it horrible? No. Was it the best? I wouldn't say that either. We ordered a shrimp po boy and oyster platter. The number one mistake I would say is that the food didn't come out hot... it was warmishly cold. The seafood tasted like it may have been frozen. The bread on my po boy was soft and didn't have much of a crunch (a little toasting could have helped). Service was prompt though, and the waiter was nice. Overall, not a place I'd go out of my way to return to, but if nothing else was open then sure I'd return. (Tip: Acme Oyster House is my favorite seafood restaurant... not just in NOLA, but possibly even in the world)",

A few blocks up the street from my hotel and off Bourbon Street this some what obscure place comes across as your typical tourist location with a sign out from \"Line Starts Here\", fortunately I was somewhat early so I missed the dinner crowd. I sat at the bar and it was pretty full all over, and I took the menu and went for Oceana's famous Char-grilled Oysters. I ordered a dozen and what I got was incredible, there were 12 nice plump oysters that had been char-grilled with a unique zesty garlic and cream herb Cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of Parmesan and Romano cheeses. It was plenty food for me and I was completely satisfied.",
